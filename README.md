## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used the site [coolors](https://coolors.co/palette/ccd5ae-e9edc9-fefae0-faedcd-d4a373) for the color scheme, I think these colors complement the purpose of the site well.

### Imagery

I have used high quality images of food to compliment the site, all my images are sourced from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images/stock).

### Favicon

I used [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) to create my favicon.

### Wireframes

I initially started drawing my wireframes and quickly realized that i was over complicating them.  
I then took a simpler approach to the remaining wireframes.

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for my wireframes.

## Features

The website is comprised of four main pages, all are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, recipes page, about page & contact page).  
And two secondary pages. (tacos page & carbonara page).  
Lastly two exta pages. (404 page & thank-you page).

#### All Pages on the website have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the text FlavorWave. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the website pages (home page, recipes page, about page & contact page). When viewing on mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when navigating a site on a mobile device.

- A footer which contains social media icons links to instagram and facebook. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### General features on each page

Each page has the same header and footer as well as theme to complete.
