## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used the site [coolors](https://coolors.co/palette/ccd5ae-e9edc9-fefae0-faedcd-d4a373) for the color scheme, I think these colors complement the purpose of the site well.

### Imagery

I plan on using high quailty images of food to complment the site. all my images are sourced from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images/stock)

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) fot my wireframes.

## Features

The website is comprised of four pages, all are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, recipes page, about page & contact page).

#### All Pages on the website have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the text FlavorWave. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home page, recipes page, about page & contact page). When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

- A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram and facebook. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### General features on each page

Each page have the same header and footer aswell and theme to complete.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

Languages used HTML & CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Balsamiq - Used to create wireframes.
